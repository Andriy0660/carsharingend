# Carsharing

### It is first my relatively large project on which I learned to apply leading technologies of spring and web development in Java. We learned to work in a team, we learned to create a MS SQL database and deploy this API using Microsoft Azure

### Also in this project I learned how to containerize a database and api in docker, which gave me good knowledge to further dive deep into docker while learning microservices
